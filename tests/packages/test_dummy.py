Test module for shared Terraform modules repository.

repository. Currently contains basic placeholder tests that should be expanded with
actual functionality tests as the Python codebase grows.

    Placeholder test to ensure the test suite runs correctly.

    This test serves as a basic sanity check for the testing framework setup.
    It should be replaced with actual tests when Python functionality is added
    to the repository.

    The test is intentionally simple and always passes to verify that:
    - pytest is properly configured
    - The test discovery mechanism is working
    - The conda environment includes required testing dependencies
    - The CI/CD pipeline can execute tests successfully

    When adding real functionality to the Python codebase, replace this test
    with comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and validation tests
    for the specific functions and modules being developed.
