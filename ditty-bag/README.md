# Ditty-Bag

This directory contains one-off scripts, repository utilities, and other small, helpful tools.

## What is a "Ditty-Bag"?

The name is a nautical metaphor. A ditty-bag is a small canvas bag used by a sailor to hold their personal articles and small, essential tools for their work (like a sewing kit for mending sails, a knife, etc.).

Similarly, the scripts in this directory are not part of the core application logic. They are small, auxiliary tools used to perform specific, often manual, tasks related to development and repository maintenance.

## What Belongs Here?

- One-time data migration scripts.
- Scripts for automating complex local environment setup.
- Utilities for analyzing repository structure or code.
- Small, personal convenience scripts.

## What Does NOT Belong Here?

- Reusable library code (should be in `packages/`).
- Core application or service logic (should be in `services/`).
- Critical, heavy-duty operational tools (a better metaphor might be a `bosuns-locker`).
- Scripts run by CI/CD (these often have their own dedicated directory).
